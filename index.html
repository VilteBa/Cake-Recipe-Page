    <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul for="ingredients">
        <li>175g margarine or softened butter</li>
        <li>175g caster sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>175g self-raising flour, sifted</li>
        <li>1tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
     </ul>
    <h2 id="method">Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180Â°C. Lightly grease an 18cm round cake tin with a little extra butter or margarine and cut a piece of greaseproof paper or non-stick baking parchment to  fit the base of the tin.</li>
        <li>Put all the ingredients into a large mixing bowl and beat with a  wooden spoon or a hand-held mixer for 1 minute, or until just  combined. It's important not to beat the batter too much - just  long enough to make it smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour or spoon the mixture into the tin, smooth the top and bake  on the middle shelf of the oven for about 45-50 minutes. The cake  is cooked when it looks well risen and golden; the top should  spring back when lightly touched with a fingertip. Another test is  to insert a skewer into the centre of the cake - it should come out clean.</li>
        <li>Let the cake sit in the tin for 5 minutes, then gently run a  knife around the edge and turn the cake out onto a wire rack to  cool. Serve dusted with icing sugar.</li>
